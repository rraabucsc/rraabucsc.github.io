PurpleHack:
 - Derivative of Crimson Pro https://github.com/Fonthausen/CrimsonPro
 - SIL Open Font License v1.1 (PurpleHack-License.txt)
 - Repackaged as .woff2  under SIL open font License with name change

EB-Garamond:
 - Original git repository: https://github.com/georgd/EB-Garamond
 - Open Font License v1.1 (EB-Garamond-License.txt)
 - .woff2 files downloaded from Google Fonts under the name "EB Garamond"
 - Some sources claim that this doesn't comply with the OFL, but the original
    source doesn't provide compiled versions of the font, only .ufo files. Under
    this logic, .ttf files would also be "derivative" fonts, no? Anyway, Google
    has expensive lawyers and they've done it...

SourceCodePro:
 - Original git repository: https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro
 - SIL Open Font License v1.1 (SourceCodePro-License.txt)
 - Using .woff2 files; see logic above.
